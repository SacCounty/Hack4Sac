{\fs20 Many people experience homelessness in a variety of ways\'96sometimes in a tent, other times in the home of a friend or family member. In Sacramento, as in most cities, there are not enough emergency shelter beds for every person that is homeless on any given night.  In the past, most bouts of homelessness did not extend past a week up to a several months, but this situation may be changing due to Sacramento County\rquote s budget problems.  If you find yourself homeless without previous preparation, this section will help you until you are able to access shelter or housing.\par Remember that many that find themselves homeless might not be so different from yourself, so there is a great resource by peer support and advice. A great starting point would be a service provider like Loaves & Fishes. You can contact them at (916) 446-0874.\par \par \par \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Keep from freezing}{\fs20  \'96 cardboard is a great insulator from the cold ground and provides some cushion when sleeping on cement.  If you don\rquote t have a tent, a tarp is a must for camping gear, and a warm sleeping bag. \par Sometimes sleeping bags are available at }

Friendship Park also provides activities, information, restroom facilities and a safe environment while you access services. The center is located at 1321 North C Street.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Staying dry \'96 }{\fs20 If you have a tent, make sure it has a rain fly or secure one tarp over the tent and one under the tent. If you do not have a tent, a tarp is very important when living outdoors. Finding a place to sleep under cover is sometimes hard to find, but many sleep communally under freeways during rain storms. Sleeping in doorways of businesses that have gone out of business is a good place to sleep out of the rain.  You can use trash bags for raincoats by cutting out holes for your head and arms. Check for sprinkler systems. \par }

{\fs20 \par }{\fs20 \par }{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Fires}{\fs20  \'96 It\rquote s best not to have campfires, especially along the parkway.  An alternative is to purchase a propane heater and/or camp stove for keeping warm and for cooking.  If you sleep in a tent, a simple candle in an open jar will provide heat for the small space inside a tent and the jar will help prevent lit candles from falling over and causing fires.  If you have no alternative and must have a fire to keep warm, dig a small pit and make sure there are no tree roots exposed to the pit.  If you need a fire to cook, use a small fire using only several twigs at a time, instead of a log. There is too much danger of fires in the summer.  \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Protection from predators }{\fs20 \'96 Use your valuables as a pillow, by sleeping with your backpack or purse under your head, or wrap a strap around your arms.  If you sleep in a hidden location, make sure that no stranger sees you enter or leave your camp.  \par }

After you cut the sleeve off, use the cut part for your feet, folding the edges so they fit around your feet flat and comfortably.  You can also keep a plastic bag over your foot. Try to keep dry between toes. Use a petroleum base jelly on your feet to deal with soreness and dryness.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Restroom facilities}{\fs20  \'96 Finding facilities open to the public are often hard to find. More and more restaurants are not allowing people to use their restrooms without making a purchase. Public and government buildings such as libraries, post offices, county administration, city hall and others are good places to go. In some buildings you will have to ask security for access.  Homeless and other services agencies usually have restrooms. Restrooms at public parks are somewhat scarce and are usually closed from early evening to morning. If no restrooms are available, urinate on dirt or vegetation, never on impermeable surfaces.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Camp etiquette and types of locations to sleep}{\fs20  \'96 Sometimes you will see a bedroll and other belongings that appear to be abandoned.  Don\rquote t assume they are abandoned.  The owner will probably come back for them that same night or even next week. Leave other people\rquote s possessions alone.  That way you perpetuate the custom so that you may feel better about leaving your possessions somewhere when you have an appointment or other reason. Don\rquote t assume your possessions will be there when you return, though, since not everyone follows that custom and sometimes the police or rangers take things (they are required to give a notice before they take your things and leave a notice where you can pick your things up, but they don\rquote t always follow this procedure).\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Dumpster Diving}{\fs20  \'96 It can be dangerous and it is illegal to go through residential garbage cans. Some businesses put useful items outside their dumpters. You can find many useful items in dumpsters and with a good stick with a hook on the end, you can safely scavenge without having to enter the dumpster. Behind laundramats may be good for blankets and clothing. If someone else is searching a dumpster, let them finish before you start. Be careful with food by checking expiration dates, freshness and ability to decontaminate (such as vegetables and fruits without cuts). \par }
{\fs20 Unfortunately if you are homeless in Sacramento, there is no guarantee of housing or shelter, and the existing shelters are often filled up. We list the resources below as a guide to trying to get help. Rapid rehousing should be your goal. When you go to a shelter, ask if there is anyone who can help you find permanent housing through a transitional housing program (see the next page). Though transitional housing programs have long wait lists, they can help you find a permanent place to live.\par An emergency shelter is a facility whose purpose is to provide temporary or transitional shelter for the homeless in general or for specific populations of the homeless.}

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Bad Conditions}{\fs20 \par If you have bad conditions in your unit, you should tell your landlord, in writing, to fix the problems. If your landlord does not fix the problems and you live in the County of  Sacramento, call Code Enforcement at (916) 874-6444.  In the City of Sacramento call (916) 264-5011 or 3-1-1.  \par Under the City of Sacramento Rental Housing Inspection program, all rental units in the City of Sacramento must be inspected at least once every five years. You have the right to live in a place that has no holes in the wall, has working toilets, sinks, electricity, heat, no rats, roaches or other pests, and is clean. The landlord has to fix things that don\rquote t work that you did not break. \par If you live in the City of Sacramento and you are told you must move by Code Enforcement (your unit is \ldblquote red tagged\rdblquote ) you may be eligible for relocation assistance from the City which will be two times your monthly rent plus the amount of your prior security deposit.  (Sacramento City Code 8.100.920 et. seq.)\par If your landlord will not fix problems, you should give written notice of the problem (remember to keep copies of everything relating to the problem), wait 30 days, and have proof of the problem. \par If you want to repair the problem yourself and deduct the cost from your rent, it must be a problem affecting your health or safety, not just something you want to change in the apartment.  Generally, the best approach is to pay full rent under protest and sue the landlord separately in small claims court.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Rent Control }{\fs20 \par Rent control regulates the percentage by which a landlord can raise a tenants rent. It also requires that a tenant can only be evicted for good cause.  The City and County of Sacramento do not have rent control.  \par }

Your rent may be increased by any amount, with a 30-day written notice if you are a month-to-month tenant, but if it is raised more than 10% in a year you must be given a 60-day written notice. \par Contact the County Board of Supervisors at (916) 874-5411 to advocate for rent control as a protection for renters.  \par }

You can also go to the Unlawful Detainer clinic at the Carol Miller Justice Center for help. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 c. Sheriff\rquote s 5-day Notice to Vacate }{\fs20 - If you don\rquote t answer a summons and complaint or lose in court, you will get a 5-day notice to vacate. If you do not move out, you will be locked out by the sheriff sometime on or after the 5th day.\par If you are being evicted, you can get help with your defense from Legal Services of Northern California. Call (916) 551-2150. They are located at 515 12th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. They can help you prepare a written response for you for free or at low cost, depending on your income. The service is also available in Spanish. You can also get help answering an Unlawful Detainer Summons from the Unlawful Detainer clinic at the Carol Miller Justice Center.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 5. Illegal Lockout}{\fs20 \par If your landlord locks you out without using the eviction process, immediately call the City of Sacramento Police or the Sacramento County Sheriff. When the police respond show them some proof that you are a tenant (receipts, ID, etc) and ask them to tell your landlord to let you back in. If the police officer does not respond, call the non-emergency phone number for Sherriff\rquote s Department  at (916) 874-5115 or the Police Department at (916) 264-5471 and ask to speak to the watch commander.  If they won\rquote t help, call Legal Service of Northern California at (916) 551-2150 for assistance.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 6. 28-Day Shuffle}{\fs20 \par If you have lived in a residential hotel for over 30 days, you are a tenant and can only be evicted through a legal eviction. You should not be asked to move rooms or leave for a few days. If this happens, contact Legal Services of Northern California or the Human Rights/Fair Houisng Commission (below). If you are locked out, you should call the police and show them your receipts. If you leave voluntarily, for example, if you don\rquote t have enough money for rent, it is not illegal.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 7. Housing Discrimination}{\fs20 \par If you are discriminated against in trying to buy property, rent, or use services provided to other tenants because of your race, color, religion, sex (including sexual harassment), nationality, handicap, marital status, familial status (whether you have children), lawful source of income (for example that you get welfare) or sexual orientation, call:\par }

The cost of your rent/mortgage payment or utilities is more than your monthly income and cash-on-hand. \par \'95\u8239 ?\u8239 ?\u8239 ?\u8239 ?
Your liquid resources are less than the gross income requirements.\par To apply for emergency CalFresh, you need to do the application and check the box that says you want expedited CalFresh. The worker will ask for your proof of identity, residence, income, and resources, but you cannot be denied for not having these documents with you. \par There are many ways to prove your identity, including your driver\rquote s license, a sworn statement, a phone call to someone who knows you, a library card, or a letter addressed to you. \par If your case is approved, an EBT card and PIN number will be issued no later than the third calendar day after you apply so you can access your food stamp benefits. If the third day falls on a weekend or holiday, you have the right to receive your CalFresh on that Friday. If you apply after the 15th you will get the CalFresh for that month and your next month\rquote s CalFresh. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Non Emergency }{\fs20 \par }{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Application: }{\fs20 You have the right to apply in your own language and to turn in a written application on the day you go in. If someone tells you to come back to submit the application, you may insist on filing an application that same day.  \par It is best to fill out the application form as completely as you can, but you only need to fill out your name, address and signature to file an application. Once you turn in your application, you will be given an interview with an eligibility worker.\par You can call (916) 874-2072 to have an application mailed to you; fill it out and send it in by mail, or have someone else turn it in for you. You will still have to be interviewed either by phone or in the office depending on your situation. Phone interviews can be scheduled to make it easier for you to finish the application.  \par You can also apply online at www.mybenefitscalwin.org.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Interview: }{\fs20  You may bring someone along to help you. You may be asked to sign a form making them your \ldblquote authorized representative,\rdblquote  but you do not have to. You will go over the application you filled out and will be asked for additional information. \par You should be given a list of documents that you will need to complete the application process. You may be given ten days to turn in the documents. If you do not have all the necessary documents, you or someone you know may sign a statement explaining why not. \par You may be able to receive benefits while you continue to gather the required information. The eligibility worker should help you get some of your missing papers.\par If everyone in your household is disabled or over 60 years of age you may request either that an eligibility worker be sent to your home at a time you agree to or that you be interviewed by phone. A worker may also visit or phone you if no adult in your household can go to the office for good reasons such as illness or disability. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Next steps: }{\fs20  If you are asked to mail additional papers to the County office, ask the worker for a stamped envelope addressed to him or her. If you take in papers, get a receipt. \par Keep your own copy of all the paperwork. If you need help and your worker is not available, the worker of the day or a supervisor should help you.  \par Within 30 days of applying, the County office must either mail you an EBT card and PIN number and a notice of approval or inform you in writing that you do not qualify and the reason why not. \par If you are denied CalFresh, and believe you are eligible, request a hearing or call a legal aid organization right away. (see page 70 \ldblquote Good Advice.\rdblquote )\par \par \par \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 1. Quarterly Reports }{\fs20 \par As of August 2013, you only have to report every six months. The form is called SAR-7. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!  You will be asked to report your income, property and household composition, and any changes in your income, property or household composition that you anticipate in the next three months. You will need to fill it out in order to continue to be eligible. Under certain circumstances, you must report changes before your required reporting month.\par }

{\fs20 If your SAR-7 gets lost, or you do not turn it in, your case will be suspended at the end of the month. If you had a good reason, such as being sick or not receiving the form in the mail, your worker may grant you \ldblquote good cause\rdblquote  and your benefits may be restored.  You have up to 30 days after your report due date to turn in your report to have your benefits reinstated regardless of whether or not you had a \ldblquote good cause\rdblquote  for not turning in your report on time.   \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Recertification}{\fs20 \par You must be reviewed for benefits each year before the end of your certification period or your CalFresh will be cut off. You will receive a letter that tells you the application for this review is due. Be sure to complete this on time so you can continue to receive CalFresh without a break. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Work Registration }{\fs20 \par All CalFresh household members age 16 through age 59 who do not have children in the home must be screened for work registration.  This may or may not be required, and is contingent upon state unemployment levels. \par If you are not found to be exempt, you must agree to: \par \'95\u8239 ?\u8239 ?\u8239 ?\u8239 ?\u8239 ?

Most food pantries are volunteer private organizations that can make their own rules about who can be served. Most of them are limited to serving people in certain areas and for one to four times a month. They may require some kind of identification and proof that you are low income. Generally, food pantries never have as much as is needed. Foods distributed most often include canned foods, rice, beans, bread, cereal, and occasionally produce items.\par Free hot meals are offered at many private volunteer agencies and churches. The frequency of the meals varies from daily in some places to once a month.\par Here are some food or referral agencies:\par 211 (County phone referral line)\par http://www.healthycity.org/region/sac\par }

{\fs20 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law. The goal of health reform is make sure that more Americans have insurance, either public or private. Medi-Cal, a state-subsidized healthcare, will expand to cover higher incomes.  More information about Medi-Cal, eligibility and the application process is below. \par Starting in January 2014, if you do not qualify for Medi-Cal or another public health care program, you will be required to have another means of health insurance. Even if you do not qualify for Medi-Cal, you may be eligible for the Premium Assistance Program. This can help to reduce the cost of your health insurance premium, which is the amount of money you pay to buy health insurance coverage each month. Depending on your income, Cost Sharing Assistance can reduce the amount of health care expenses an individual has to pay when getting care. These expenses include copayments and other health care bills. \par Covered California\rquote s Health Benefit Exchange marketplace can help you find affordable health plans and answer any questions you may have.

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 10. If You Are Disabled }{\fs20 \par If you have certain severe physical or mental problems, (such as mental retardation or inability to walk) or if you have AIDS, you may also be able to get Medi-Cal based on disability even before the state determines you are disabled. This is called "Presumptive Disability". Bring medical reports that show you are disabled when you apply. Both children and adults can get disability Medi-Cal. \line \line The Medi-Cal Program for Aged and Disabled Persons provides  Medi-Cal services at no Share of Cost if you are not able to work and are 65 years of age or older or disabled. Information about the Working Disabled program is on page 25.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 11. Women (and Men) with Breast or Cervical Cancer}{\fs20 \par If you are under 65 without health insurance, or underinsured (you have high premiums, deductibles, co-payments or Share of Cost) and you have been both screened and diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, you may get free Medi-Cal immediately and during the entire time you are receiving cancer  treatment, depending on your income.  There are no resource limits for this program.\par If you do not qualify for the above program because of age or immigration status, you may still get time limited Medi-Cal for cancer-related services only under a more limited \ldblquote state only\rdblquote  program.  Under that program, breast cancer treatment for men or women is limited to 18 months (which includes males who have been screened and diagnosed with breast cancer),  and cervical cancer treatment is limited to 24 months.  \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 12. Retroactive Benefits}{\fs20 \par If you had medical or pharmacy services from a Medi-Cal provider in the 3 months before you applied for Medi-Cal, ask your worker for a form to apply for \ldblquote retroactive benefits.\rdblquote  The mail-in application also asks if you want this. If you were eligible for Medi-Cal during those 3 months, Medi-Cal may pay those bills. If you\rquote ve already paid the bills and Medi-Cal covers the services, your clinic, doctor, dentist, or pharmacist should provide the refund to you.  If you have trouble getting a refund, call Legal Services at (916) 551-2150.\par \par \par \line Your countable income determines whether or not you can get Medi-Cal for free or whether you have to pay a \ldblquote Share of Cost.\rdblquote  (You only pay a "share of cost" in months when you actually use services.)  Certain types of income don\rquote t count or can be subtracted. The different Medi-Cal programs count the income limits differently. It\rquote s important when applying for Medi-Cal to report income and expenses including:\par \'95 Up to $175 (this may be subject to change) for child care for each child age 2 and over \par \'95 $200 (this may be subject to change) for childcare for each child under age two \par \'95 Court-ordered child and spousal support paid \par \'95 Child support received\par \'95 Educational expenses \par \'95 Business expenses of self-employed parents. \par Once a family qualifies for Medi-Cal, hundreds of dollars of their earnings might not count against their eligibility.\par Elderly (65 and older), blind or disabled persons can\tab  deduct (these amounts may be subject to change):\par \'95 $20 \par \'95 $65 from earned income \par \'95 Half of any remaining earned income \par \'95 Any health insurance premiums paid by you. \par Some elderly or disabled people, even though not receiving SSI, may get free Medi-Cal if the countable monthly income is less than a certain amount. This is called the \ldblquote Aged and Disabled Federal Poverty Level\rdblquote   Medi-Cal program. If you are over these limits you can still get Medi-Cal, but there will be a share of cost.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Special Low-Cost Medi-Cal for Working Disabled \tab Persons: }{\fs20 \par If you are a disabled working person or are married and both of you are working and disabled, you can get lower cost Medi-Cal if your income if you meet the income requirements. If you qualify, you will have to pay a monthly premium that goes up the more income that you have. Income deductions and exemptions apply, so apply even if you think your income may be too high; you can contact Legal Services of Northern California at (916) 551-2150 if you are denied. \par \par }

The home you live in, furnishings, personal items, and some non-term life insurance policies don\rquote t count. Other real estate may not count if you are not the only owner or are not able to sell it.  For some Medi-Cal programs one car does not count, and for some programs a car is not counted if its value is under a specific amount.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 \par \par \par 1. Who Pays Share of Cost}{\fs20 \par Some people must pay, or agree to pay, a \ldblquote Share of Cost\rdblquote  for each month that they have a medical expense. Medi-Cal will then pay the rest of the bill for covered services that month. You do NOT have to pay a Share of Cost if: \par \'95 You are in one of the groups that receive free Medi-Cal (such as those getting CalWORKs, SSI, foster care, adoption assistance, 1931(b) Medi-Cal, or the aged and disabled programs).\par \'95 Your countable income is below certain income limits.\par If you have Medi-Cal with a Share of Cost, you begin each month with your Share of Cost limit. You don\rquote t have to pay anything in months that you have no medical expense. You can use past medical bills and the medical bills of family members listed on your application to meet your Share of Cost, including unpaid bills that they are trying to collect from you. You cannot count the same billed item or service twice, but you can carry the balance of an unpaid bill over to later months if a bill is for more than your Share of Cost. If your income goes down, notify your worker so your \ldblquote Share of Cost\rdblquote  will go down.}
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 \par 2. Share of Cost: Children }{\fs20 \par Children whose income is too high for free Medi-Cal can get Medi-Cal with a Share of Cost (see the Childrens\rquote  Health Care section on page 28). You can find the premiums at 1-800 880-5305. Even if a child\rquote s parents start making more money and the parents have to start immediately paying a Share of Cost as a result, the child still receives Medi-Cal for free until their "Annual Redetermination." \par \par }
{\fs20 \par \par }{\f8\fs20\b\i0 1.\u8239 ?Once a Year Eligibility Form}{\fs20 \par Individuals receiving Medi-Cal must have their eligibility rechecked (or \ldblquote redetermined\rdblquote ) every 12 months. You get a "redetermination packet" in the mail which you must fill out and send back.  You do not have to send in copies of documents with your redetermination form. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Mid-Year Status Report For Adults}{\fs20 \par Some adults recieving Medi-Cal must fill out the Mid-Year Status Report (MSR) in order to keep Medi-Cal.  Some groups of people do not have to fill our the MSR:  a child under 21; the parent or guardian of a CalWORKS child; pregnant women who have reported their pregnancy to the county, people who are disabled or over 65, or someone in the  Breast or Cervical Cancer Program. The report should come about 5 months after you start getting Medi-Cal and must be returned to the Medi-Cal office by the date on the form.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Reporting Changes for Adults }{\fs20 \par Adults must report to DHA any significant changes that may affect your eligibility within 10 days after the change. You must quickly report to your worker if you move, begin making more money (or less money), someone moves in or out of your house or you are pregnant. Even if you report a change that hurts your eligibility, you have important rights before the DHA cuts your Medi-Cal.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 4. Losing Welfare Does Not Mean That You Lose Medi-Cal }{\fs20 \par Leaving the CalWORKs program (for example because of a sanction, time-limit, or failure to comply with WTW rules) does not mean that you lose free Medi-Cal. If you lose your Medi-Cal after you leave welfare, contact Legal Services at (916) 551-2150 for help and advice. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 5. Transitional Medi-Cal }{\fs20 \par You might be eligible for up to 1 year of free (no Share of Cost) Medi-Cal (called transitional Medi-Cal or TMC) if you received CalWORKs or what is called "Section 1931(b) Medi-Cal" during at least 3 of the last 6 months, and you lost CalWORKs or Section 1931(b) Medi-Cal because you started making too much money. \par During the first six months of TMC, you and your family qualify for free Medi-Cal no matter how much income you have. \par After that, you remain eligible for TMC if you received TMC for the entire six months; you are still living in California;you remain employed; you have a child under 18 in the home; and you meet the income qualifications. \par Eligible families can receive TMC for up to one year. There is no lifetime limit on TMC. If your income goes down you can qualify again for regular Medi-Cal.   If it then goes up again you can return to TMC with new time limits. \par There are no \ldblquote resource\rdblquote  or property limits for TMC. TMC requires quarterly reports like a QR-7 for cash aid, but on a different form.\tab \par }

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 6. Four Month Continuing  Medi-Cal }{\fs20 \par If you lose CalWORKs or Section 1931(b) because you start getting more child or spousal support, a family can get free Continuing Medi-Cal, regardless of your income, but just for 4 months. It is important that you turn in an SAR-7 or any other change reporting form explaining why you are leaving CalWORKs or Section 1931(b), to help make sure you get Transitional or Continuing Medi-Cal. The children\rquote s free Medi-Cal continues until their next scheduled annual redetermination.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 7. Former Foster Children}{\fs20 \par If you were in Foster Care on or after your 18th birthday and you were "emancipated," you are automatically eligible for free Medi-Cal until you turn 21 even if your income goes up. Chldren leaving foster care before their 18th birthday are not eligible for this program. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 8. If You Get A Notice That Medi-Cal Will Be Cut Off}{\fs20 \par DHA must send you a written notice of action at least 10 days before it cuts off, denies, delays or reduces your Medi-Cal benefits. The notice explains the reason for their action and your right to ask for a fair hearing. (See pg. 67 Hearings and Complaints).\par When a change occurs affecting your Medi-Cal eligibility, DHA must determine whether you are eligible for any other type of Medi-Cal, before sending you a notice of action cutting off your benefits. They have to look in your available records, including CalWORKs, CalFresh and other records for any missing necessary information. DHA can send you a form that only asks for the information it needs; it cannot ask for information it already has or does not need to determine whether you are still eligible for Medi-Cal. \par DHA must give you at least 30 days to complete the form. If you do not send in a completed form, DHA will send you a written notice of action that you will lose your Medi-Cal benefits. If your form is incomplete, DHA must first try to contact you by telephone and writing to get missing information before it cuts your benefits. If you send in your form within 30 days of being cut from Medi-Cal, and that information shows you were still eligible, DHA must restore Medi-Cal benefits without making you reapply.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 9. If You Move}{\fs20 \par You must report a move to the Medi-Cal worker right away. You should have no break in service if you move within California. If you move to a new county, report to DHA and also to the welfare office in the new county, and the counties will manage the transferring of your case. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 10. If You Were Billed Twice}{\fs20 \par The doctor or health service provider cannot bill both you and Medi-Cal for the same care. If you think your doctor has billed you unfairly, you should contact Legal Services. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 11. Lost or Stolen Cards }{\fs20 \par Notify your Medi-worker and a replacement card will be sent to you. If there is a medical emergency, you may receive a written notice of eligibility at your welfare office. \par \par \par \par \par There are two ways to receive your medical care under Medi-Cal in Sacramento County:\par \rdblquote Fee for service\rdblquote  (regular Medi-Cal), or Geographic Managed Care (GMC) which gives services through private health plans.   Medi-Cal participants except for people on SSI and people in long term care must use GMC.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 1.\u8239 ? Fee for Service (Regular Medi-Cal)}{\fs20 \par In Fee for Service Medi-Cal you can use any doctor, clinic, hospital, pharmacy or other provider willing to accept Medi-Cal. You must tell the doctor or clinic that you have Medi-Cal before you get care. If you don\rquote t, the provider can legally bill you for all services that you get. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Geographic Managed Care}{\fs20 \par In Sacramento County, everyone except people in nursing homes or people who ask for and are given special permission must use \ldblquote geographic managed care\rdblquote  (GMC) for their physical health issues.\par }

{\fs20 When you join a GMC plan, you must see the doctors, pharmacists and hospitals that are part of your plan. You must select a GMC plan.  Unless you have an emergency, you must get approval for all care from your GMC  provider.  The GMC will receive money each month for your health care even if you don\rquote t get services. The GMC is responsible for providing or making arrangements for you to get all Medi-Cal covered services. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3.Dental Care}{\fs20 \par Due to severe budget cuts by the state, only children, pregnant women, and persons in long term care can get Medi-Cal coverage for dental services. See page 31 for Dental Clinics.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 4. How to Choose a GMC Plan}{\fs20 \par When you first enroll in Medi-Cal you will get a packet in the mail. The packet will contain a form for you to choose a GMC Plan.  You will be able to choose one of five GMC Plans: Kaiser, HealthNet, Molina and  Blue Cross.\par  Fill it out the \ldblquote choice form\rdblquote  and return it.  It\rquote s a good idea to send the form by certified mail. If you don\rquote t complete the form and return it within 30 days, the state will choose a GMC Plan for you.  \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 5. Hearings, Grievances, and Leaving a GMC Plan }{\fs20 \par If your HMO denies services or you are not satisfied with the services, you have many options. You can file a grievance with your GMC Plan.  Your HMO must tell you how to file a grievance. The GMC Plan must resolve your grievance within 30 days, or less if you have an emergency. If you are still not satisfied complain in writing to the Department of Managed Health Care HMO Help Center, IMR Unit, 980 Ninth Street, Suite 500, Sacramento, CA 95814-2725. Their phone number is   (888) HMO-2219, TDD (877) 688-9891. You can also go to their website at  www.hmohelp.ca.gov.\par You have the right to ask for a fair hearing to dispute anything the GMC Plan does. (see page 67, "Hearings and Complaints.") While waiting for a state hearing, the GMC Plan must continue to provide medical services to you.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 6. Mental Health Managed Care}{\fs20 \par Mental Health services for Medi-Cal recipients are also provided through a managed care system operated through \ldblquote Local Mental Health Plans\rdblquote  in each county.  For further discussion of these services (see page 32 \ldblquote Mental Health Services.\rdblquote )\par \par \par \par If you are between 12 and 21 years old and a citizen or legal resident, you can apply for \ldblquote Minor Consent  Services\rdblquote  to get free and confidential medical treatment without parental consent related to:\par \'95\u8239 ?
Drug or alcohol abuse treatment or counseling (except methadone treatment) \par \'95 Sexually transmitted diseases \par \'95 Pregnancy and abortion \par \'95 Family planning \par \'95 Outpatient mental health (not overnight in a hospital) \par \'95 Sexual abuse\par Your parents won\rquote t be required to give information about their income or resources or pay toward the medical services, unless you want Medi-Cal for services other than those listed above. \par DHA won\rquote t tell your parents or send Medi-Cal mailings to your home without your permission. These services can be used by minors even if they already have Medi-Cal or any other health program.  \par To apply, fill out the regular Medi-Cal application and another short form for Minor Consent Services at DHA or with a DHA Eligibility Worker at the site where you are receiving care. You will have to fill out a new short form each month you need treatment, except for mental health services. For that, you need a letter from a mental health professional explaining that you meet certain conditions for getting mental health services and how long you will need treatment. You will still have to complete the short form each month to update your eligibility.\par If you already get Medi-Cal through your parents\rquote  case, you may already have a plastic Medi-Cal card. But don\rquote t use the plastic card for Minor Consent services. You will be sent a temporary card to use instead.\par \par }

You cannot legally be paid full benefits from both programs for the same period. \par However, if your Workers\rquote  Compensation benefit rate is less than your SDI rate, SDI may pay you the difference between the two rates.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Long-term or Permanent Disability:}{\fs20  If you expect your disability to be long-term or permanent, lasting for more than one year, apply for SSDI and/or SSI from Social Security well before your year of SDI is over (see page 57 for Social Security Programs).\par }

Workers\rquote  compensation is a no-fault system, meaning that injured employees need not prove the injury was someone else\rquote s fault. There are six basic types of workers\rquote  compensation benefits: \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 a. Medical Benefits:}{\fs20  The employer pays for the medical care resulting from the work-related injury. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 b. Temporary Disability Benefits: }{\fs20 These are paid every two weeks if you are unable to return to work within three days or are hospitalized overnight. The benefits are intended to partially replace two-thirds of the wages lost as a result of the injury, up to a maximum of $840 per week (this may be subject to change). For most injuries, payment will not last more than 104 weeks. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 c. Permanent Total Disability: }{\fs20 If you have a permanent total disability you receive disability benefits each week for life. \par d. }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0  Permanent Partial Disability: }{\fs20  The \ldblquote percentage of disability\rdblquote  is based on a medical evaluation.  You receive weekly benefits for a period that increases with the percentage of disability, from 4 weeks for a 1% permanent disability up to 694 weeks for a 99% disability. Those with a permanent partial disability of 70% or more also receive a small life pension following the final payment of permanent partial disability benefits.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 e.  Vocational rehabilitation services: }{\fs20 These services are for when you are unable to return to your former type of work after the job injury. You are entitled to these services if they can reasonably be expected to return you to suitable gainful employment. The amount you receive will be less than Temporary Disability Benefits.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 f.  Death benefits: }{\fs20 If a worker is fatally injured, the employer pays burial expenses up to $5,000 and support payments for dependents. This amount may be subject to change. \par }

Earned Income Credit (EIC)}{\fs20 \par \ldblquote The Earned Income Credit\rdblquote  (EIC) is a check that low-income working people can get from the government by filing a federal income tax return or filling out a W-5 form during the year, even if your income is so low that you do not owe federal taxes. You need a valid social security number to get this money.\par Yearly income qualifications for earned income credit can be found at http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Preview-of-2012-EITC-Income-Limits,-Maximum-Credit--Amounts-and-Tax-Law-Updates. Note the higher income limits for married people.\par If you are receiving CalWORKs, the Welfare Office cannot count this payment as part of your income if you spend the money in the month received or the month after. For the General Assistance program, this money does count as income.\par You can also file for \ldblquote retroactive\rdblquote  payments from the past three years. If you do not owe taxes, there is no penalty for filing for the credit late (after April 15th). \par You can claim EIC on the tax form (1040 or 1040A) or you can fill out just the first side of \ldblquote Schedule EIC\rdblquote  instead and the IRS will figure it out for you. However, you may not use the 1040EZ form (the shortest form) to claim your EIC. \par For help getting the credit you can call the EIC hotline at         \tab (800) 601-5552. To get a 1040 or 1040A form for this year and past years, and to receive free tax assistance, call the IRS at  (800) 829-3676 and ask for VITA-Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. Forms are also available in libraries, post offices and other public places.\par If you choose, you can receive this payment spread out during the year in lower payroll tax deductions instead of getting it all at once at the end of the year. To do this, ask your employer to fill out a W-5 form.\par }

Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit}{\f2\fs24\b\i0\cf2\outl0 \par }{\fs20 Families who pay for child or dependent care in order to work or look for work may be eligible for money or reduced taxes from both the federal and state governments. The dependent can be a child under the age of 13 or a dependent of any age who is unable to care for him or herself, including a disabled spouse. \par Parents will receive up to 35% of child care expenses, with certain limits. The amount you get is generally higher if your expenses are higher.\par For both the federal and state credits, you must have a social security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). You must have income from work and must provide the social security number of the child or dependent that is receiving care, and the name, address, taxpayer identification or social security number for the person or agency providing the care. \par The state credit is limited to families that meet income requirements.

{\fs20 CalWORKs provides money for children under 19 years old and the relatives caring for them. Work and training are required of most adults. Most adults can only get CalWORKs cash aid for 24 months in a lifetime (as of 1/2013), although an individual assessment will determine how many months of aid you will receive). If you qualify for cash aid, you are also entitled to Medi-Cal for healthcare and CalFresh (food stamps). In Sacramento County, the CalWORKs agency is called DHA, the Department of Human Assistance.\par Both one parent and two-parent families can get cash aid. In two-parent families, one of the parents must be disabled, or the parent that has earned the most money in the last two years must have worked less than 100 hours in the last four weeks before applying for cash aid. \par Children must live with a related adult and be 18 years old or under. Some 18 year olds can get cash aid until their 19th birthday if they will graduate by age 19 or have a disability that kept them from graduating.\par If you are convicted of a drug-related felony after 1997, you cannot get any CalWORKs aid for yourself, but your children can still get cash aid.\par For more information about CalWORKs, see the CalWORKs Fact Sheet on the DHA website: www.dha.saccounty.net.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2.

There are certain exceptions for cars, such as a car you live in, a car you need for a business, or a car used to transport a disabled person.\par The maximum grant is cut dollar for dollar by any \ldblquote unearned\rdblquote  income you have, such as social security survivor\rquote s benefits, interest (like on a bank account), or unemployment money. Earned income, wages from work, or income based on a disability is not counted dollar for dollar, although the first $225 of disiblity or earned income will not count. Half of the remaining earned income after this amount will not count. (www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf)\par Families that have a disabled parent qualify for the higher \ldblquote exempt\rdblquote  amount. See the CalWORKs Fact Sheet on the DHA website for more information: www.dha.saccounty.net.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Think About Time Limits Before You Take Cash Aid}{\fs20 \par You may not want to get cash aid if you have other income. Any month you get cash aid counts against the 24-month time limit, even if you are entitled only to a few dollars a month. You can get Medi-Cal, Food Stamps and child care money even when you do not get cash aid. Is the cash aid you will get worth \ldblquote using up\rdblquote  a month of eligibility? Should you \ldblquote save\rdblquote  the month in case you need it more at a later time in your life? Call Legal Services to discuss your options.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 4. Maximum Family Grants (\ldblquote MFG\rdblquote )}{\fs20 \par You will not get more cash aid for children born while your family is getting CalWORKs. There are certain exceptions. Ask the worker or consult with a legal aid organization.\par }

If they won\rquote t give it to you, contact the Civil Rights Liaison in the office or call Legal Services for help.  \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Documents To Bring When You Apply}{\fs20 \par When applying for CalWORKs, bring the following documents with you. If you do not have some of them, go ahead and apply, and get a list of documents to be brought in later. Ask the worker to help you obtain missing documents. \par \'95 Identification with your name and current address on it.

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 4. Fingerprint Requirement}{\fs20 \par All adults (age 18 and over) and teen parents must be fingerprinted in order to apply for and get CalWORKs. If you refuse to be fingerprinted, your cash aid will be denied, or stopped if you're already getting it. If you are scheduled for fingerprinting on a day that will not work for you, ask to reschedule.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 5. Next Steps}{\fs20 \par Keep in touch with your DHA eligibility worker and write down his or her name, phone number, and phone hours. If you are asked to mail additional papers to the welfare office, ask the worker for a stamped envelope addressed to him or her. \par If you take in papers, get a receipt. Keep your own copy of all the paperwork. If you need help and your worker is not available, the Worker of the Day should help you. \par Within 45 days of when you turn in your application, you must either receive your first payment, or a notice that you have been denied aid. If the DHA denies your aid, they must send you a letter explaining the reason. Do not sign a \ldblquote withdrawal\rdblquote  of your application unless you understand and agree with the written reason you are given.\par If you are approved for cash aid for yourself, you will be required to participate in WTW unless you qualify to be excused (also called "exemption" or "good cause"). You will be getting an appointment letter to WTW shortly after you are approved for cash aid.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 6. EBT Card}{\fs20 \par DHA will give you an EBT \ldblquote electronic benefits card\rdblquote  (Golden State ADVANTAGE) to use at banks, ATM machines and stores. You access your cash aid and food stamps ("CalFresh") through the EBT card. Ask your worker for a list of banks and ATMs near you that will not charge you a fee.

Every six  months, you must  report changes in income, property or the number of people in your household. DHA will mail you a SAR-7 report form for you to do this.  The SAR-7 will also ask you to report any changes, including changes you expect in the next six months. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Report All Your Income And Gifts}{\fs20 \par You should be careful to report all income you get or changes in your family. The welfare department will check bank, employer, and tax records to check your income, and accepts tips of suspected \ldblquote welfare fraud\rdblquote  from the public.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Cooperate with Child Support Collection}{\fs20 \par Unless it could put you or your children in danger to do so, parents on cash aid must help (\ldblquote cooperate with\rdblquote ) the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) to collect child support from any absent parent. You must provide information you have about the other parent. You will get your CalWORKs grant plus an extra $50 per month for every month the other parent pays on time. \par If you do not cooperate and do not have a good reason (such as fear of the other parent), your grant will be reduced 25%.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 4. Get Immunizations (\ldblquote Shots\rdblquote ) For Your Children}{\fs20 \par When you apply for CalWORKs or at your annual redetermination, you must show proof that your children under age 6 have had their shots. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 5. Keep School-Age Children in School}{\fs20 \par If your child is under 16 and not attending school regularly without good cause, the adult\rquote s cash aid will be cut off. If your child is over 16 and not attending school, or welfare to work activities, without good cause, only that child\rquote s aid will be cut. In either case, the cash grant will be restored when you prove to DHA that the child is in school or has good cause. \par \par \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 1. Weekly Participation Hours}{\fs20 \par The following rules apply to most families. As of January 2013, if you are a single parent with a child under 6, you have to work or participate in \ldblquote welfare to work\rdblquote  activities 20 hours a week, unless you are excused.\par If you are a single parent with no children under 6, the participation requirement is 30 hours a week unless someone is exempt. Two-parent families must work 35 hours, which may be shared by both parents, but one parent must do at least 20 hours or more per week.\par If your child is under two years old, one adult per family may be excused from welfare to work activities (this can only occur once in the adult\rquote s lifetime. \par If you are exempted for caring for a child between 12 and 23 months old or two children under 6 before January 2013, this exemption continued until you are called in to be \ldblquote reengaged\rdblquote  in Welfare-to-Work as a mandatory participants (when reengaged, your 24 months of the full Welfare-to-Work activities will start; see below).\par If you have used the one-time child under 2 exemption, you can still be exempt for caring for a child 3-12 months old. The length of time you are exempt will depend on your county\rquote s policy. The time will count against your limit, though. (see www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf)\par }

{\fs20 If you need Mental Health, Substance Abuse or Domestic Violence Services, they can count towards your hours (or you can be excused or do fewer hours). \par DHA must give you an exemption from WTW, meaning you do not need to do WTW, if you are: \par \'95 Caring for a first child under 12 months old, or any later child under 6 months old\par \'95 Pregnant, and DHA agrees with medical verification that the participation or work will harm your pregnancy\par \'95 Under 16 years old\par \'95 A full time volunteer in the Volunteers in Services to America (VISTA) program.\par \'95 You are a youth who is not pregnant or parenting and is 16 to 18 years old\par \'95 You are disabled for 30 days or more \'96 can mean physically or mentally unable to particiapte for 20/30 hours per week for participation or work as verified by a doctor\par \'95 You are 60 years or age or older\par Any months exempted for the following reasons do not count against your CalWORKs 48 month time clock;\par If you do not qualify for an exemption, you may have good cause that excuses you from doing something WTW asks you to do. The 48-month time limit is not stopped by good cause (except see below on domestic violence). \par Good cause includes:\par \'95 Not getting supportive services you need (such as child care and transportation) to work or go to a WTW activity\par \'95 Child sick at home from school\par \'95 No transportation (for example your car broke down)\par \'95 You are homeless \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Domestic Violence Waiver:}{\fs20 \par DHA can waive some of the CalWORKs rules for victims of domestic violence, such as stop the 48 month time clock, not participate in WTW, stop child support collections, or waive the maximum family grant rule. The violence can be something that happened in the past or in the present.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Learning Disabilities}{\fs20 \par All WTW participants must be offered a learning disability (LD) screening. \par You can say you do not want the LD screening, but if you change your mind, you can ask for LD screening and evaluation anytime.  \par If the evaluation shows you have a learning disability, your welfare-to-work plan must have activities that help you deal with your learning disability, such as tutoring or extra study time. DHA must decide whether job search will be useful for you, or if your time limits should be extended.\par \par \par At present the services include:\par }

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Money for tools, books, fees, and uniforms}{\fs20  if needed for work or training. DHA does not pay for tuition.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Mental Health Services:}{\fs20  You should receive a mental health screening during orientation. Also, a DHA worker can suggest to you that you go to a mental health evaluation if they think you have a mental health barrier to finding or keeping a job. You can also ask for mental health evaluation anytime by calling your eligibility worker or WTW worker. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Substance Abuse Services: }{\fs20 You can ask for help with substance abuse treatment at anytime by calling your eligibility worker or WTW worker. If you find it hard to get or keep a job because of problems with alcohol or drugs, the DHA worker can refer you to a substance abuse clinical assessment. You may get help through a variety of rehabilitation services. You can continue getting these services as part of your WTW requirements while receiving cash aid.\par You can go to a substance abuse treatment program as the WTW activity. You have the right to refuse any substance abuse treatment program as the WTW activity; however, if you do not go to a treatment program, you cannot use substance abuse as a reason to not work or not participate in WTW.\par \par \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 1. Orientation and Appraisal}{\fs20 \par Soon after you apply for cash aid, you will get an appointment letter to go to WTW orientation.  During the orientation, you will be told about WTW rules, time limits, and work requirements.\par After Orientation, you will meet with your WTW worker in a one-on-one meeting called Appraisal. You will talk to your worker about your work and educational history, what kind of services you need (such as substance abuse, mental health, or if you are a victim of domestic violence), and anything else that will help you get the services you need in welfare-to-work. \par If you are already enrolled in an education or training that may qualify as a Self-Initiated Program, you need to tell your worker at Appraisal. This will let you do the education and training as your WTW activity instead of going through Job Club (see next column) and the rest of the WTW process.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Job Club}{\fs20 \par Unless you are already in school or working, Job Club will probably be your first WTW activity. Job Club is a four week activity. The WTW worker can shorten the job search requirement if they think it will not help you find a job.\par You don\rquote t have to do job search if:\par \'95 It would interfere with a full time job you already have\par \'95 You are enrolled in a Self-Initiated Program of college or vocational training\par \'95 You are in the Cal-LEARN program\par \'95 Doing a job search would not help you (example: you need basic English or literacy training first)\par \'95 You need other help with domestic violence, mental health, or substance abuse.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. Assessment and WTW plan}{\fs20 \par If you don\rquote t find a job in the first three weeks of job club, at the end of that week, you will have a \ldblquote vocational assessment\rdblquote  to determine your next WTW activities. \par The worker will then come up with a WTW Plan based on your individual goals and needs. Don\rquote t sign the WTW plan unless you understand and agree with it. Get a copy of it. The plan must be based on the assessment of your needs and skills. Ask for a hearing, a third party assessment, or call Legal Aid, if the plan is not what you want. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 4. Self Initated Programs}{\fs20 \par If on the date of your WTW appraisal you are already in school or training, or have enrolled to start school, your education or training can count as your WTW activity. This is called a SIP (\ldblquote Self Initiated Program\rdblquote ) because you chose it yourself. It could be a college or vocational program. If you already have a 4-year college  degree, you cannot do a SIP unless it is for a teaching credential.\par If you are a SIP, you will not have to follow the core/non-core activities requirement.  \par DHA has a list of approved SIP programs.  If you are in a program that is on the approved list, DHA must approve it. If the program you are in is not on the approved list, DHA should approve it if it leads to employment. You need either a letter from a college counselor or letters from three people in your field of study stating that your program will lead to employment for DHA to approve it.\par To continue in a SIP you must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree or certificate that leads to employment.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 5. Help To Keep The Job\'97Post Employment Services }{\fs20 \par Once you have found a job, the WTW program can help you with money for transportation, training,  tools, uniforms, and similar costs. WTW may be able to provide you limited help after you stop getting CAlWORKs because you found a job. You may be able to get two years of child care payments. You must ask for this money to get it. \par You may also continue to get Medi-Cal and CalFresh benefits after you leave CalWORKs, even if your income is too high.\par }

{\fs20 \par \par In January 2013, a new Welfare-to-Work (WTW) 24-Month Time Clock was established within the CalWORKs 48-Month Time Limit. Your own time limit will be based on an assessment. The aid does not have to be used 24 months in a row. After the adult has been aided 24 months, their part of the grant is cut, but their children can still get aid. \par People already on CalWORKs before 1/1/2013 will have up to 24 months, or whatever time is left on their 48 month clock, to finish their educational activities in their welfare-to-work plan. If you finish your educational activities and have time left on your 48 months limit, you must do federal activities (generally work) in order to keep getting aid. (see www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf) \par Certain months do not count against the 24 months of activities. They may count against the 48-month limit, though. These are 1.) if you are developing your work plan; 2.) have good cause for not participating; 3.) are on sanction; or 4.) you are meeting the federal rules for work participation (for single adult families, this means doing 20 hours of work or the first 12 months of vocational education). (see www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf)\par The 24-month limit can be extended if all adult parents or caretaker relatives in the home of the aided child meet any of these tests:\par \'95 60 years or older\par \'95 Disabled, receiving State Disability  Insurance, Temporary Workers\rquote  Compensation, In-Home Supportive Services or SSI, and unable to work or go to WTW\par \'95 Not able to go to WTW or employment because of an \ldblquote impairment\rdblquote , for example a learning disability or chronic mental illness. You must have a history of \ldblquote full cooperation\rdblquote  in WTW for a sustained period.  Full cooperation means no sanctions and satisfactory attendance. \par However, even with a sanction this exemption can be granted if you were ever in WTW for 6 months straight, or if you were in WTW for two periods within a two year period that are equal to six or more months.\par \'95 There are no local jobs that accommodate your disabilities\par \'95 A non-parent relative taking care of a child \ldblquote at risk of foster care placement\rdblquote  and that limits your ability to go to WTW or employment. Example, if you are a grandparent under age 60 who cannot both be regularly employed and care for the child, DHA can continue your CalWORKs aid rather than having the child enter foster care.\par \'95 A domestic abuse survivor who cannot do WTW because of the abuse. You do not have to be in a domestic abuse situation now. You will also qualify if you are suffering from the effects of past abuse and the effects limit your ability to go to WTW or work.\par You only need to tell your worker (\ldblquote self-declare\rdblquote ) about the domestic abuse; no other proof, not even a police report, is required unless the County has proof the information you gave was questionable. Your time will be extended for as long as you continue to suffer from the effects of the abuse or are in danger of more violence.\par \'95 Taking care of an ill or disabled household member if DHA agrees that this harms your ability to participate or work. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Clock Stoppers or Exemptions}{\fs20 \par Apply for an exemption to \ldblquote stop the clock\rdblquote  for any months which should not have been counted in your time limit. Your request should be in writing, but can be verbal.   \par DHA has to send you a written decision within 15 days of the request (unless something happens that is beyond the DHA\rquote s control). If you disagree with the decision you may request a state fair hearing.  DHA is required to look at your case records before asking you to provide information or documentation which you already turned in. \par Months that do not count toward your time limit include:\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 \'95 Sanctioned or No Check}{\fs20 \'97Any month you do not get a CalWORKs aid payment for yourself even if you receive various services like child-care or job training or counseling.

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 \'95 Domestic Violence}{\fs20 \'97Any month you cannot participate in CalWORKs as a result of domestic abuse. You do not have to be in a domestic abuse situation now. You also qualify if you are suffering from the effects of past abuse. You only need to tell your worker [\ldblquote self-declare\rdblquote ] to qualify; no other proof, not even a police report, is required.\par }

Make sure that you get a copy of the form stamped by Social Security with the date it was filed. The form is also available online at www.ssa.gov. \par If you request a Reconsideration within the time period given on the notice (usually 10 days), your benefits can continue unchanged until you receive a decision.   If they paid you too much, and they want to take money out of your check, you can request a waiver if it wasn\rquote t your fault and if it would be hard for you to pay the money back. Ask Social Security for the waiver form. \par In SSDI cases, you must fill out a separate form asking for your aid to continue. This is called \ldblquote payment continuation.\rdblquote   If you miss the deadline given in the notice, the aid will be cut or reduced, but you still have 60 days from the date you received the notice to request a Reconsideration.  After 60 days, if you have \ldblquote Good Cause\rdblquote  for missing the deadline, you may be allowed to file a Reconsideration.  If you win the Reconsideration, your lost benefits will be paid back to you.  \par There are three types of Reconsideration: case review, informal, or formal conference.  However, if your application for SSDI or SSI is denied for medical reasons, you can usually only get a case review.  \par If your reconsideration or waiver is denied, you may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) with the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR).  At the hearing you may  appear in person, submit new evidence, examine the evidence used in making the determination or decision under review, and present and question witnesses.  The ALJ who holds the hearing may ask you questions.  He or she will write a decision based on the hearing record.  If you waive your right to appear at the hearing, the ALJ will make a decision based on the evidence that is already in the file.\par When you are receiving SSI or SSDI and then start working, your benefits could be cut if you are working and earning too much. (This is known as \ldblquote Substantial Gainful Activity\rdblquote  or \ldblquote SGA\rdblquote ). 10 days after you get the tentative notice, a notice that your payments will stop will be sent to you. Request a reconsideration immediately. To protect yourself, it is best to make a new application at the same time you request a Reconsideration. \par If you are considering going back to work, know your rights.  Call }

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 1. Basic Benefits}{\fs20 \par GA benefits provide monthly cash aid in Sacramento County. In addition to the cash aid, a bus pass is provided. \par Once approved, you can earn up to money each month with no loss of benefits. \par Go to the DHA office to apply for GA. Not all DHA offices take GA applications. (see pg. 68 for DHA Offices).\par Be prepared for a long day, but remember that you have the right to apply. Tell the worker at DHA that you need GA. You will have to fill out an application. Bring with you identification and papers that prove your income, resources and citizenship (your birth certificate is best but other documents can work). If you are an immigrant bring documents that indicate your status.\par \par Every GA applicant has a right to request \ldblquote expedited\rdblquote  CalFesh (food stamps) (see pg. 13 - Emergency Food Stamps).\par If you are eligible, DHA must issue you food stamps within three days of your application if you are eligible to receive expedited food stamps. \par Make sure that your worker has a good address for you; otherwise, you may miss important notices from DHA. Your home address and mailing address do not have to be the same.  If you are homeless, you can use the DHA address to pick up your mail,  but if you do, you must check your mail once a week. Some community organizations and shelters provide free mail service. \par You must be helped if you are in the office before it closes. If you need help immediately, you should receive it. If anyone does not let you apply or tells you to come back the next day, insist on speaking to a worker, and then a supervisor, and then the deputy director, if necessary.\par The county has 30 calendar days to approve your case and issue you GA benefits. Your benefits will be issued to you on an Electronic Benefits Transfer (\ldblquote EBT\rdblquote ) card.   When your EBT card is issued to you, you will also select a personal identification number (\ldblquote PIN\rdblquote ).  Using your EBT card and your PIN, you can access your benefits through any ATM. Your DHA worker should provide you with a list of ATMs in the area.  This list will let you know which ATMs are free and which ones charge a fee.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. If You Think You Are Unable to Work}{\fs20 \par If you are disabled you may want to apply for SSI first (see pg. 26 - SSI). You may apply for GA while you wait on SSI. You can ask the county to help you apply for SSI. If you get GA because you are unemployable you must apply for SSI.\par If you are disabled, apply for GA as \ldblquote unemployable\rdblquote . You should bring any medications, prescriptions, private doctor\rquote s statement, or other proof about your disability.  \par }

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. If You Need Special Assistance}{\fs20  \par DHA must help if you need it. If you cannot read or write, they must help you with their forms. If you have a mental disability, they must refer you to a mental health worker for evaluation. The evaluation can establish you as a Needs Special Assistance (\ldblquote NSA\rdblquote ) recipient.  NSA recipients are approved for GA promptly.  In addition, \ldblquote NSA\rdblquote  participants are protected from some sanctions, work and other program requirements, and denials of aid.\par If you request an evaluation by a mental health worker, but do not get one, you may demand that you be classified as \ldblquote medically unemployable\rdblquote  for 30 days. You will be exempt from work requirements until you get a mental health evaluation. \par }

On the quarterly report, you will be asked to report your income, property and household composition.  You will also be required to report any changes in your income, property or household composition. \par If you get the form in the mail, you must fill it out and return it to the DHA office by the 5th day of the month. You should get a report form before or on the first day of the month. If you don\rquote t get it in the mail, you may call the automated phone system at (916) 874-3100 to request a form be mailed, or go to the DHA office to complete the form. \par }

After the third penalty in a year, you have to wait 60 days to re-apply. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 3. If You Begin to Get SSI}{\fs20 \par GA is a \ldblquote loan\rdblquote  from the county.  If you begin to receive SSI, the amount you received on GA will be automatically deducted from your first SSI check. \par }

Help from Shelters; Public Education; and services from many non-profit agencies.\par These programs don\rquote t have immigration requirements and if you are undocumented, you may qualify.  You do not need to tell anyone that you or anyone else who lives with you are undocumented.  Your workers do not need to ask about your immigration status if you are not getting benefits for yourself.  If they do ask you, simply tell them that you are a \ldblquote not qualified\rdblquote  immigrant (\ldblquote not qualified\rdblquote  is not the same as undocumented).  That is all they need to know. \par If a school or child care center asks for your social security number on a form, you can write \ldblquote none\rdblquote  on the form or leave it blank. They may not give the information on that form to a government agency.\par }

\par Most lawfully present immigrants, such as legal permanent residents, refugees, asylees, and persons granted withholding of deportation, can get CalFresh (food assistance) benefits, CalWORKS, General Assistance, County healthcare, Housing Assistance,  and Medi-Cal. If they have a sponsor, the sponsor\rquote s income may count as part of their income for five years. \par Refugees who have been in the country less than 8 months and persons who were granted asylum less than 8 months before,  can also be eligible for}
{\f8\fs20\b\i0  Refugee Cash Assistance }{\fs20 (generally this is for able bodied adults without children. Victims of trafficking may also qualify for Refugee Cash Assistance once they receive certification. Call the local DHA office listed on page 68.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Social Security:}{\fs20  If you are a non-citizen who has paid into the Social Security system as a worker or had money taken out of your paycheck for this program, you may qualify for Social Security disability, retirement or survivor benefits (see Social Security, pg. 56). \par }

{\f8\fs20\b\i0 \par 1. What Is Public Charge?}{\fs20 \par If you are applying to become a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) and you are using health care programs (such as Medi-Cal , In Home Supportive Services, or Healthy Families) or CalFresh, it will not hurt your chances of getting your green card by making you a "public charge".   You might have a problem getting your green card if you have used cash welfare or long-term care (like a nursing home) depending on your situation. Cash aid for your children or other family members will not effect your immigration status unless it is your family\rquote s only income. \par Officials will look at many factors, including your age, your health, your entire family\rquote s (or sponsor\rquote s) income and resources to determine whether in the future you will be likely to need to rely on cash welfare to live.  Past use of cash benefits may not count against you, for example if it was several years ago that you received the benefits or if it was only for a short period of time.\par You do not have to worry about public charge if you already have a green card (unless you leave the US for more than 6 months at a time and try to re-enter), or if you are applying for citizenship, are a refugee or asylee, or are applying for a green card based on having lived in the US since before 1972.\par Victims of domestic violence who file a self-petition under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) are subject to the "public charge" test. However, they can use all benefits, including cash welfare, without affecting this decision.\par The government should not demand that you repay any welfare you correctly received as a condition of giving you legal status.  If this happens, call one of the immigrant advocate agencies. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 2. Sponsors}{\fs20 \par Most new immigrants entering into the U.S. through family members are required to have a sponsor sign an \ldblquote affidavit of support\rdblquote  form.  This form is a promise to the government that the sponsor will help to provide economic support for any sponsored immigrants.  \par If you are a sponsored immigrant and you want to apply for certain government benefits, your sponsor\rquote s income and resources may be added to yours in determining your eligibility for benefits (this is called \ldblquote deeming\rdblquote ).  This deeming rule makes the income of many immigrants too high to qualify for benefits.  There is no deeming if you are applying for health care programs, only for CalFresh and cash assistance programs.  \par Deeming does not apply to some immigrants, including: refugees, asylees, parolees, victims of domestic violence who have filed a \ldblquote self-petition\rdblquote  for an immigrant visa, or certain other immigrants who are not required to have a sponsor.  In addition, some programs have exception for very low income persons called \ldblquote indigence exceptions\rdblquote . The rules for there are different for each program. Ask about this when you apply.\par If you have a question or problem with \ldblquote sponsor deeming\rdblquote  contact one of the agencies listed at the end of this page.\par \par \par If you are arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):\par }

{\fs20 If your CalFresh, CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, In Home Supportive Services or CAPI benefits are reduced or stopped by the welfare office and you don\rquote t agree, you should file for a fair hearing with the California Department of Social Services.\par In a fair hearing, you will have a chance to explain what happened to you, and after hearing your side and the welfare office\rquote s side, an impartial referee will decide who wins. If someone calls you and says that you don\rquote t have a case, continue to insist on a hearing until you have received adequate legal advice.\par You must be sent a written notice 10 days before any action is taken that will reduce or stop your benefits. The notice must explain clearly the reasons for the action. If you disagree with this action and you formally request a fair hearing before the date the action takes effect, then under most circumstances your aid will not be cut until the hearing (unless it ends for another reason, like your certification period ended).\par If you do not ask for a fair hearing before the date the action takes place, your aid may be reduced or cut, but you still may fight the action if you ask for the hearing within 90 days of the date the notice was mailed. Save the envelope your notice came in and a copy of your fair hearing request so you will have proof that you met the required deadline. You can ask for a hearing after that if you have a good reason for filing late.\par To request the fair hearing, you may fill out and return the form on the back of the notice or write a letter doing so in your own words.   \par You can also request the hearing by calling the toll-free number set up for this purpose, }

Remember to write down the name of the person you spoke with.\par You cannot make a hearing request with your worker or any other County staff. You must either call the 800 number or send the written request to the Appeals and State Hearing section.\par The state will send you a notice  with the date, time, and place of your hearing.  Usually, this happens within 3 or 4 weeks. Currently, in the CalFresh program, anytime before the hearing, you can request a delay (\ldblquote postponement\rdblquote ) of the hearing in order to have more time to prepare or to get an attorney or advocate. In other aid programs, or to get a second postponement, you must have a very good reason  (\ldblquote good cause\rdblquote ).\par You may be called or get a letter from the county hearings representative assigned to your case. The hearings representative  will be presenting the county\rquote s side at the hearing. The hearings representative will also write up the county\rquote s side at least 2 days before the hearing. You have the right to get a copy of the county\rquote s position statement. If the hearings representative does not have it ready for you to see before the hearing, you may request that the hearing be postponed to give you the chance to read the statement. This postponement does not count against you.\par The hearings representative may offer to settle your case. This is called a conditional withdrawal. Think about this carefullly. If you agree with what the county is offering, you can accept the conditional withdrawal. If not, you can reject it and go to the hearing. You can also try to negotiate for a deal that you like.\par If you are disabled, or homebound, hearings can be held by phone, at the welfare office or in your home, but you must ask for this in your hearing request.\par You must also be provided with an interpreter for the hearing at no cost if English is not your first language. \par After your hearing, call the toll-free number and complain if the state takes longer than 60 days to get a decision about food stamps, or 90 days if the hearing was about CalWORKs or Medi-Cal. These are usually the maximum amounts of time that are permitted to decide such cases (starting on the date of your request for hearing). If your hearing decision takes longer than 90 days and you have never continued it, you must get extra money for the delay, if the decision is granted in your favor.\par If you do not win the hearing and you are still convinced you are right, you can request a rehearing, within 30 days or file an appeal in court within 1 year.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 More Advice:\par }{\fs20 For hearings about GA or County health care in Sacramento County, you have only 10 days to request a hearing with the County. The back of the Notice of Action should tell you how to ask for a hearing. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Seek advice and assistance.}{\fs20  Talk to a legal worker or a well-informed friend or community person about your situation. \par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 Keep good records and save all papers that an agency gives or mails to you. }{\fs20 Write down the name and time of anyone you speak with in person or over the phone and the time you had the conversation.\par You have a right to see your case file and to copy anything you need in it. You have a right to see any regulations or instructions that apply to your situation.\par }
{\f8\fs20\b\i0 If you are disabled,}{\fs20  the law says that the welfare office must help you, so ask for help you need when you request a hearing. If you are treated unfairly because of a disability or health problem, send a complaint letter to the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Dept. of Justice, P.O.
